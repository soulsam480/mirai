## Mirai
> [WIP] University placement platform

To fully understand what Mirai does, please check the [excalidraw board](./mirai-platform.excalidraw). To track alpha release plan, please look into https://github.com/soulsam480/mirai/issues/51

### Status
- Pre alpha

### What's happening rn ?
As I'm busy with my office work, don't have much time to continue working on Mirai for now. This doesn't mean Mirai is being abandoned. Initial release plan for mirai still remains the same, and all the ideas are already inside the [excalidraw board](./mirai-platform.excalidraw). My reason behind building Mirai was to learn backend and production React/Next programming. That motivation has changed quite a lot in the last few months with me also planning to take this to market. With that being said, I'm not done with it and will continue my work along with [@Manish](https://github.com/t-rex777) in near future when both of us are free and have extra energy to spend. Mirai is going public today (13/08/22). I hope this will become something bigger. Thanks.
